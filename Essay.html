<h2>Things are complicated</h2>
Upon growing up for seven years in the Australian Victorian education system,
I've come to pick up a few things that don't seem fair. I'm not afraid to voice
my opinion about a system that needs to be thought about in a less complicated
manner. Victorian high schools' majoritively teach the essentials (Math, English, Humanities) from
year seven to year 9 under no VCAA supervision, and in my experience has been
taught with hardly any given context, from what I've noticed, and the content does not fittingly appeal to the large
demographic in school. As a result, students do not grow up appreciating and
valuing the content talked about and taught at school.

School in general is a rat race to get good grades, study at the daily grind and
punish the brain by memorising information that will not stay in long term
memory for more than a year at most. What school needs is a better teaching
  system. The education system in general relies on a defunct method of
  teaching and learning called the "traditional education system", which enforces
  students' memorise content and repeat what they've learned on paper in a
  standardized test. This has been the conventional school education system for
  quite some time, and although it HAS gone through extensive modifications and
  adaptation to modern methods, the basic principal has not changed. This
  system of education can be observed in several countries, including the USA,
  Britain, Australia, Japan, China, and smaller countries. For the duration
  of this written piece I shall discuss my experience with the native Victorian
  state of Australia's education system, governed by the governmental authority
  VCAA, known by the substantially jargon laced title of the "Victorian Curriculum and
  Assessment Authority".

  I do not believe it is relevant to mention how VCAA came about, however I will mention
  that the very origin of the authority is quite hard to directly determine. Doing a bit
  of research, I have found some information:

  <a href="http://www.artshub.com.au/education/member-profiles/industry/victoria/education-and-training/victorian-curriculum-and-assessment-authority-136095">There is an article on Artshub</a>
    which more or less answers the "what is?" question. <p>

    </p><i>"The mission of the VCAA is to provide high quality curriculum, assessment and reporting that enables individual lifelong learning."</i>, according
    to this site. I sure that's the main motive of the authority, but I believe
    the "when did VCAA form?" question is answered pretty clearly with this statement:
    <p>
    <i>The Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) came into operation on 1 March 2001 and is the successor to the Board of Studies. It is an independent statutory authority primarily accountable to the Minister for Education, serving both government and non-government schools. The VCAA is also responsible to the Minister for Children and Early Childhood Development and the Minister for Higher Education and Skills in relation to sections of Part 2.5 of the Act that they administer.</i>

    Okay, that was more than what was needed. But you basically get when it was formed now, right?
    I also found in my research the initial legislations for the formation of
    VCAA. You can view it <a href="http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubStatbook.nsf/51dea49770555ea6ca256da4001b90cd/2226ee6af4f7e5b6ca256e5b00213f5d/$FILE/00-096a.pdf">here</a>
    The document is an enactment by the victorian government to establish VCAA. It's all guidelines "assented" on the 5th of December 2000, and the act came into operation the first of December 2001,
    thus VCAA was first formed on December 2001. I'm not in any way a genius of political methods and I have no idea what followed after this establishment. My only concern is the application of this
    legislation, not the principals or the theories.
<br />
<br />
    <b>So why should I care?</b>
<br />
<br />
    I'm just a student, why should I care how the government deals with teaching? Well I believe all students have a right to care about the issue,
    ultimately they, as a large body, undergo first hand the methods and policies of this governmental body. I am of course no representative of any
    political body, and I definitely don't plan to be... <i>ever</i>. What I see from politics is a bunch of slightly older middle age men with suits and comb over hair debating
    about the same issue for months and get literally nowhere with the issue. I see men (and women) playing baby games with each other on live TV. They are infected with a
    vocabulary of pure bullshit jargon and every goddamn issue has to be colour coded and defined its own section on some legislation. In my eyes the Australian government is utter
    scum of the Earth. No wonder our society hasn't progressed much in the last 30 years or so!

    I can't even come to understand why this is still a system people are conforming to. I am sickened to think of what goes down in parliament grounds.
    I could see, however, this system working if and only if both political parties were open-minded enough to view any issue equally. I just believe issues could be solved
    easier if there was a better system in place.

    Anyway, back to the main issue, a bureaucratically run education system. I am going to work with this issue with an open mind, accepting any flaw I may present as these are my own
    generated ideas being typed out as I think. One of the main issues with VCAA and VCE in general is the lack of proof that testing students on retained knowledge will benefit society.
    The method required to teach students knowledge in a short-term high-school setting is redundant. It is not needed. Perhaps I am biased because I hate how teachers' teach in a school setting, and therefore
    is influencing my arguments. But it is true, I really do hate how information is taught. For example, in Physics, we learn about Faraday's Law, except we do <b>not</b> learn about the historical background of the Law,
    the context to the law and <i>who (Michael) Faraday <b>actually</b> is!</i>. VCAA presents every subject a "study design", an excruciatingly stupid outline for both teachers and students on <i>what must be taught no if no buts it will be on the exam.</i>.
    Setting up a list of similar ideas circulating a larger concept which <b>must</b> be learnt, because ultimately it will be accessed and examinated on. A student is required to learn this information through both textbooks and teachers. They have no choice.
    But, why? I cannot understand who decided these must be learned. Why? The problem with this design is that it sets up learning for failure. It sets up a system where you cannot question what you are learning, you cannot go deeper on what you are learning and
    benefit from it, and (commonly on most study designs) you will not be required to learn about the historical background on a topic. <br />
    Perhaps I, a person who connects ideas together, building an overall picture of a fundamental concept and apply it to learn more about humanity, society, the world and reality. VCAA, is not trying to teach students about this. VCAA is trying to teach students how to work.
<br /><br /><br />
    <b>The GAT</b>
<br /><br /><br />

The GAT is another in a section of flawless examples of why VCAA in all their glory, flaunt their stupid influence over senior school children.
The GAT (General Achievement Test) is a cacophony of questions that are presented to students to answer in a period of over 3 and a half hours.
The first time I heared about the GAT, I was confused what it was for. <i>Was it like another NAPLAN?</i>. Turns out it is a method used
to predict how well students will go on their final exams. Again I am shockingly confused who thinks this stuff can just be methodically
presented to students and it is going to succeed <b>consistently</b>. It's standardized testing at its finest. Pure bureaucracy. They have these people called, "chief assessors."
that treat students' as numbers. They have no sympathy for how well they go. And why should they? It's the students fault if they get bad results.
I also overheard on one such lecture about the GAT the consequence <i>of students performing lower than what they had on the GAT in the middle exams.</i> The school could be audited.
An audit for something that is pure probability. I continue to lose my faith in this system of education. <i>Do you see where I'm coming from? They have never cared about what the students know. They only care about if they are ready to work, like goddamn vegetables being grown to be brought at a grocery.</i>
But I digress. I am an outlier. Someone who is not ripe or crisp enough to be put on the truck and sent to the nearest shopping corner. I am a sorry salary. A peeved potato. A crying carrot. Nobody but a few people will know how it feels to consistently fail every test because the information is not being absorbed.
The system is structured so that those who do well will succeed in life. What's there for those who try but fail every time? Are they expected to get back on their feet and try again? What if they have suffered enough trauma from trying?

<br /><br /><br />
My final verdict
<br /><br /><br />
I am a seventeen year old student attending a reasonably popular secondary school. Every school day I am flaunted with shadowed bureaucracy disguised under a trench coat of examinations and tests. My only wish is to learn without conflict. A place and system designed entirely for people like me. A rare few who live to learn, not learn to live. Every day I get closer and closer to the end of school.
My fears of the unknown grow larger and larger. I look outside and into the world for answers on the internet, books and other people, but I see and hear the same stuff... My lifestyle seems like it is unwanted. My views, my concerns, but passions, are not needed. I open a window to call out, but there is no air to breathe.
